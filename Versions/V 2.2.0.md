## Bug fixes
- An items default tags weren't being applied in the correct order inside <span style="color:brown">**StartComponent**</span> if the item didn't have the tag inside the struct, causing <span style="color:brown">**CheckCompatibility**</span> to always fail.
- <span style="color:brown">**CheckCompatibility**</span> was not taking into account if the destination container belonged to an item it was containing, allowing two items to contain each other.
