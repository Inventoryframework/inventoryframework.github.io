# Versions
 
# :icon-git-branch: Version system
Versions are labeled like so:
**MajorIteration**.**MinorIteration**.**Patches**

 - **MajorIteration**: New large features, small or large changes to existing files. Updating from one major iteration to another might break some things and downgrading might be difficult. These updates might change fundamental behavior.

 - **MinorIterations**: Adjustments to functions, optimizations, new tools or new small or medium sized features. These updates should not break anything, but might still cause initial compile errors.

 - **Patches**: Bug fixes, crash fixes, anything that is minor and shouldn't cause any compile errors, these are generally safe to update to.
