# :icon-git-branch: Version system
Versions are labeled like so:
**MajorIteration**.**MinorIteration**.**Patches**

 - **MajorIteration**: New features, small or large changes to existing files. Updating from one major iteration to anotherr might break some things and downgrading might be difficult.

 - **MinorIterations**: Adjustments to functions, optimizations. These updates should not break anything, but might still cause initial compile errors.

 - **Patches**: Bug fixes, crash fixes, anything that is minor and shouldn't cause any compile errors, these are generally safe to update to.
