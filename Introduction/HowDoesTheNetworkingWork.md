# How does the networking work?

Certain inventory data can become quite large, especially with how many containers and items you allow in an inventory. But at the same time, we must store the data on the server, otherwise a client could modify their data before the StartComponent function is called and cheat the system. But to optimize, we try to simplify things. Players only receive data from components that they request data from and data from their own components, but also any update from components they are currently interacting with.
The component keeps track of the players that are currently interacting with a component with the Listeners array, then whenever PlayerA moves, adds, removes or interacts with an item in some way, the component sends RPC calls to the other “listeners” so their widgets and data get updated.
