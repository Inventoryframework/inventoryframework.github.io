# Suggested Plugins

This is a list of plugins that I personally suggest you use alongside this plugin. None of these are mandatory and completely optional.

Unreal Engine's built-in Gameplay Ability System (GAS) is extremely powerful and is becoming an industry standard. There is a problem with it though; it's very beginner-unfriendly. It's annoying to make attributes and can take a long time to set it up. The plugin GASCompanion does all the heavy lifting for you, has good documentation and good Discord support. I am not implementing a attribute or ability system with this system because I believe you should be using GAS (Either a plugin or your own implementation).

The default save and load system in Unreal Engine is not good and is in desperate need of major revamp or improvements. While Saviour's documentation is a bit weird, the code underneath it is excellent and makes the save and load system triple A quality and the developer is very active on its forum thread.
I will be supporting saving and loading with the default save system. I am not experienced enough in custom saving and loading to create a custom C++ solution.

If you plan on having a large item data base and you have an icon artist, this plugin makes working with that data base way better.
