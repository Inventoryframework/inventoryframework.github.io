# Suggested Plugins

This is a list of plugins that I personally suggest you use alongside this plugin. None of these are mandatory and completely optional.

Unreal Engine's built-in Gameplay Ability System (GAS) is extremely powerful and is becoming an industry standard. There is a problem with it though; it's very beginner-unfriendly. It's annoying to make attributes and can take a long time to set it up. The plugin GASCompanion does all the heavy lifting for you, has good documentation and good Discord support. I am not implementing a attribute or ability system with this system because I believe you should be using GAS (Either a plugin or your own implementation).

DearImGui is a great tool used in tons of game engines and is amazing for debugging your game.
You can get blueprint support through <a href="https://github.com/TheEnbyWitch/ImGuiBlueprint" target="_blank">**ImGuiBlueprint**</a> (I have a <a href="https://github.com/Variann/ImGuiBlueprint" target="_blank">**personal repo**</a> where I've added more widget support)
I sometimes use this plugin to quickly visualize data from a bunch of items while in-game.

This plugin lets you customize the editor without touching C++. This way you can add UMG widget tools into the item data asset all inside blueprints and without touching the plugin.

I make other plugins to solve problems when I'm making games. These are MUCH smaller and simpler plugins compared to IFP.
Some of them are unfinished, some of them might have bugs, but due to their simplicity and small size, the chances of bugs are low and fixing them is pretty fast.
