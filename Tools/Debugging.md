## Item Inspection
<span style="color:violet">WBP_Inspect</span> has a ToggleDebug button on the top bar.
You can use this for figuring out what rotation you want to feed into the generated icon settings.
Pressing any of the XYZ buttons will rotate the mesh by the amount set in the slider. You can also manually put in a value in any of the text boxes. Zoom refers to the camera distance from the item.
