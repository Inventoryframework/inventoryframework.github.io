# Item Editor
The item editor is a simple, but powerful tool that allows you to select any item the asset manager can detect and directly edit the asset without opening a new window.

This tool is also meant to provide a simple interface for designers to create tools to help with their workflow. There are two tabs, the library and the editor. The library simply is where you can find all your assets and filter them. The second tab is your asset editor. At the bottom you'll find a toolbox. By default there aren't many tools in here, but it is meant for you to expand for your games needs.

## Tool box
With the asset comes a icon editor, with more tools for this tool box coming in the future.

- The icon editor allows you to edit the inspect and generated item icon settings, and allowing you to see how the item will look like in game with whatever item widget you have selected. You might want to go into <span style="color:violet">**WBP_ItemWidgetPreview**</span> and setting the default widget class to a class you commonly use.
