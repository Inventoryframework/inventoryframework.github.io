# Tools
All editor utility widgets are stored inside Plugin folder -> Content -> Core -> Widgets -> EditorUtilityWidgets -> Tools.
Any widgets or special components for each editor utility widget is stored in its own folder named after the editor utility widget inside the EditorUtilityWidgets folder.
This is done so you can bookmark/favourite the Tools folder and have access to all the tools quickly. You can also find all your editor utility widgets at the top of the editor -> Tools -> Tools, though there is no way to separate the inventory tools from your own editor utility widgets.

## IMPORTANT
All widgets, classes or files inside the EditorUtilityWidget folder is NOT designed to be used for a shipping product. If you wish to use anything inside this folder or any widgets used for these tools for your shipping product, you are responsible for ensuring it works properly.

Some tools  have a TIPS AND TRICKS comment in their event graph.
