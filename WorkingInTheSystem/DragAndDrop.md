# Drag and drop

---
A lot of the information <span style="color:brown">**PerformDrop**</span> function needs to do its calculations and logic should be stored in <span style="color:violet">**W_Drag**</span>.
This is because setting and resetting all that information for all the tiles to optimize memory is simply just so much hassle compared to just putting your stuff in the drag widget, which is always just 1 of so itâ€™s always optimized for memory and no hassle in managing it.
