# Saving and loading

Everything is saved in structs, so it should be compatible with your save system. It’s up to your save and load system to manage this, but if you need an example, the demo project has an example of a simple save and load system.

But let’s be honest, Unreal Engine’s save system is not very good and lacks too many fundamental features. I recommend a plugin from the marketplace called [Saviour](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/savior).
